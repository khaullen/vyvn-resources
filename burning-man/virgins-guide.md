# Virgin's Guide

## Lingo
**Black Rock City**  
* The city that exists for 1 week during Burning Man
* Resides in Black Rock Desert

**the playa**  
Is used both as another term for Black Rock City or can specifically mean the center area of Black Rock City that is open with art

**deep playa**  
* The areas of Black Rock City that have no inhabitants
* It’s dark
* It’s fun to explore

**playa names**
* Some people go by a different name while at Burning Man
* Your playa name must be given to you by someone else

**Esplanade**
* The inner street of the circle where all the partying, loud music and play happens

**MOOP**
* Matter Out of Place
* Garbage, garbage, garbage. If you see any garbage, it is your responsibility to pick it up.
* Never, ever, ever litter out on the playa.
* Do not bring glitter, feathers or any fabric that will pill.
* You will hear this acronym a lot.

**playa foot**  
When you don’t properly clean the dust off of your feet and your feet turn into something disgusting. I don’t want to know what this looks like.

## What does theme camp placement get us? 
**Placement**
* A provided amount of space and specific spot on the map

**Early arrival**
* We will request 15 passes for arrival on Friday.

**Reputation**
* Burning Man will know who we are
* We’ll get a MOOP score in the end
    - If we do really shitty, they may not give us placement the next year

## What to pack with you while you’re on the playa?
You will need a backpack with you since you will be off for extended periods of time - going back to your camp is usually a trek.

**Necessary**  
* Water
* Headlamp
* Goggles
* Dust masks

**Also helpful**  
* Tin for MOOP
* Driver’s License (to drink)
* Lotion
* Sunglasses
* Sunscreen
* Chapstick
* Baby wipes

## Tips & Tricks
**Gear**
* Bring a pair of sneakers or boots that are comfortable, you will be doing a lot of walking and biking
* Bring enough layers to be able to handle temperatures in the 40s
* Bring light clothing to handle temperatures as high as 110

**Lighting yourself up**
* You will be a hazard if you do not have lights on yourself at night
* It is extremely dark out there - it’s not a festival where overhead lighting is setup for you
* You will need at least one light for your front, one light for your back and one light for your bike
* It is easiest to sew an el wire onto some article of clothing you know you can easily wear every day (a belt, a backpack, a scarf, a hat)

**Storing your clothes & supplies**
* It can get dusty, _really_ dusty
* Putting your clothes and supplies in plastic bins can prevent them from getting dusty - you’ll feel much better when you can put a fresh pair of clothes on

**Bikes**
* Get a basket for your bike
* They’re perfect for holding fur coats or for transporting ice
* You need a bike lock for your bike
    - You only need to lock it to itself
    - No one means to be malicious but someone while fucked up will accidentally take your bike

**Put your name and location on all of your belongings**
* Most likely someone will bring it back
* There is a Lost & Found at center camp that your items might also be returned to

**Vinegar + Water mixture**
* The “dust” out on the desert does not come off of anything with just water
* You can use a mixture of vinegar and water in order to dissolve the dust and get it off your skin, clothing, etc.
* If it’s a really dusty year, make sure to clean your feet off with vinegar and then put lotion on them before you go to sleep - this will prevent you from getting playa foot

**You will need an ID in order to drink**
* The cops are relentless out there and will look for camps serving alcohol without checking IDs
* Same goes if you are serving - you must ID everyone that you serve, no ID they don’t drink
* Some people bring a photo copy of their ID to carry around, laminated, and it has been said this works.
