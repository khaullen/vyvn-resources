# Ticket Sale Information

1. There is no guarantee of getting a ticket in the sale. Tickets will likely sell out within an hour. There are problems with the ticketing website every year.
2. The population cap is set by BLM and is limited by road capacity. This cap is about 65,000 people.
3. It is much easier to sell a spare ticket than to find one to buy.

So that being said, everyone who is able should plan on:
* attempting to buy two tickets in the sale
* arranging to be at a computer with reliable internet connection for 1–2 hours at the time of the sale

## Purchasing Process
Due to credit card processing limits, the ticketing system implements a queue which (in theory) gives people the chance to buy in the order they arrived. Tickets will sell out within an hour but you need to be there right when it opens or you will end up behind 50k people in the queue. Last year the queue started letting people in a couple minutes early. 

The ticketing process seems to be improving under Ticketfly but you still shouldn’t be surprised if everything crashes or gets overloaded.

Get your tickets delivered by mail if possible. The will call line could be upwards of a 4 hour wait when you have the potential to be in a 10 hour gate line on top of that.

## Before the Sale
* Create a Burner Profile: https://profiles.burningman.com/.
* Log in to your Burner Profile any time from 12pm PST 3/16 — 12pm PST 3/18 and pre-register for the individual sale.
* Create a Ticketfly account and enter your shipping/billing addresses.
* Make sure the credit or debit card you plan to use is a Visa or Mastercard.

## Day of Sale
* Sale starts on 3/23 at 12pm PST / 3pm EST.
* Use a computer with a reliable internet connection (not a phone).
* Arrange your day so you can wait up to an hour or two until you get in and then buy immediately.
* Log in to Ticketfly before the sale starts.
* Follow the link to enter the sale 5–10 minutes before the sale opens. Use the link that will go out by email a day or two before. (There is also a link on the Burner Profile page but that site went down during the Directed sale.)
* If you see a message saying the sale is not open yet, refresh the page until it is.
* When the sale opens, you will see a green button. Click it to enter the queue.
* Once you are in the queue you will see an "estimated wait time" page. Wait and let the page refresh automatically. (It’s not clear whether your queue position is tied to your browser session or Burner Profile but either way there shouldn’t be any advantage to refreshing the page manually at this point and if you do it might actually reset your place in line.)
* If you see a blank page or the page doesn’t load at all then the Ticketfly servers are overloaded and all bets are off. You will probably need to keep refreshing and hope for the best.
* When your turn comes, buy two tickets, delivery by mail (unless you have a reason to do otherwise). Again, will call is not recommended as it can increase the amount of time you wait at the gate by upwards of 4 hours.
* Pay with Visa or Mastercard.
* Save the confirmation code.
* Check that the confirmation email arrives within a few hours.
* Start packing…
